The app I developed was designed to help users track their daily weight, view progress, and receive SMS notifications for reaching milestones. It supports multiple user accounts, allowing for personalized weight logs, and addresses the need for a simple, effective tool for weight management. The app also offers SMS notifications to remind users of their weight goals, making it a solution for those focused on monitoring their weight.

The user interface (UI) was designed with simplicity and accessibility in mind. Key screens include a login screen for secure user access, a weight entry screen to log and view weight entries, and an SMS permissions screen to manage notifications. The design was successful due to its clarity, ease of navigation, and immediate feedback, ensuring that users can interact with the app effortlessly.

In terms of coding, I used a modular approach, organizing components for easier debugging and reusability. Regular testing, including manual testing on emulators and devices, was crucial in ensuring the app functioned smoothly. This process revealed areas for optimization and confirmed that the app provided a good user experience.

Throughout the development process, I faced challenges, particularly in managing permissions for SMS notifications. I innovated by creating a flexible permissions system that allows the app to function effectively whether or not the user grants permission for SMS. One of the standout successes was the integration of SQLite for database management, where I demonstrated strong skills in ensuring efficient and secure data handling.
